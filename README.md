Quick docs because I'm tired
====================================

### Getting Started ###

For now, cloning the repo and opening test/index.html in firefox nightly 28+ will suffice

### What is this thing? ###

I've been getting on with haskell and clojure recently. Thus, everything looks like a wonderful, concise nail for my new hammer. I've decided to port most of the basic tools that these languages supply to ES6 as an exercise that probably-maybe-won't ever turn into a real project.

### What can it do? ###

Currently it supports fairly nifty pattern matching, function composition, discriminated unions, lazily mapping/folding/etc over sequences, ranges, automatic partial application and more. See test/testfuncs and test/tests.fjs.js for applied samples.

### This upsets me ###

Then it must have matured into usefulness!
